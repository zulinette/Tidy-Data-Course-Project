# Introduction
This repository contains an R script that collects and cleans the data. The data was taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set". 

# Script Overview
This script creates a Project_Data folder in your working directory and then downloads and unzips the dataset from the UCI Repository. It then loads all the datasets that will be use. 

At the end the script generates a text file named "tidyData.txt", that contains the dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. This file is saved in the Project_Data folder created at beginning of the script.
